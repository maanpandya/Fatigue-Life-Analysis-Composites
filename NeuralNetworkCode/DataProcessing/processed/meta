data2: 273 rows UD CA
oldest with simple temp fill

data3: 273 rows UD CA
better temp fill

data4: 253 rows UD CA
data3 but with Fmax instead of Ffatigue, removed lnominal as it is constant for this set
and with tensile and compressive strenght in kN

data5: 253 rows UD CA (most complete set)
data4, but with tens and comp in both force and stress

data6: 253 rows UD CA
data5, but no directly related cols: only forces and absolute dimensions
